## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_111`**  or later - [Official Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) <br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE - [Official Download](https://eclipse.org/) <br>
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious)) <br>
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace
5. **EclEmma** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given 
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click > `Next` > `Next`
6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * If unable to successfully import (i.e. errors showing up), reimport it and select 'overwrite'
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you may discard those changes. Remember not to push these changed files if settings are local.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish. (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process) You may check on its progress via the progress bar at the bottom right corner of Eclipse.
```

* To check for code coverage by JUnit tests or manually using the TaskManager, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Coverage as` > either `JUnit Test` or `Java Application`, depending on which is needed

### Review code quality

We use [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) to perform code review of common security concerns, code style violations, best practices, code coverage and other metrics to Codacy on our projects.

### Automated coverage reports

We use [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) on top of EclEmma to generate JUnit tests coverage reports as the development progresses.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file). (simplified by [provided batch file](#generate-jar-file) on windows)
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.

#### Generate .jar file

Run `Generate Jar build.bat` located in root folder. Alternatively, run `gradlew shadowJar` via terminal in the project root folder. More info on [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file). TaskManager.jar generated will be found in `build/jar`.

#### Prepare for gitpush/Clean files

Run`Clean_and_prepare_for_gitpush.bat` located in root folder. This will clean up files created by running the application via Eclipse, collate files using [Collate-TUI.jar](https://github.com/collate/collate) and then generating a new .jar file.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Features](#features)
* [FAQ](#faq)
* [Command Summary](#command-summary)

## Getting Started

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_111` or later installed in your Computer.<br>
   > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
   This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
   
1. Download the latest `TaskManager.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.
2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Task Manager. It is advised to create a folder and place `TaskManager.jar` in it before running the application as it creates configuration and data files in the folder it is in.
3. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. 
4. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. <br>
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window. 
5. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.<br>
6. Some example commands you can try:
   * **`add do homework, from noon to 1pm #homework`** : adds a task `do homework` for today from 12pm to 1pm tagged `homework`
   * **`edit 1 starttime, 11 in the morning`** :  updates information stored
   * **`delete 1`** : deletes the 1st indexed task
   * **`exit`** : exits the app

## Features
> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * The order of parameters is fixed.

#### Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`
> Help is also shown if you enter an incorrect command e.g. `abcd`
```
