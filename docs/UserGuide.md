Examples:

* `b data/backup/backup1`
Wrong Examples: 
* `backup C:/TaskManagerBackup` - TaskManager does not have permission to write in root folder of C drive
* `backup data/backup/backup<1>` - Invalid characters `<` and `>`

#### Change working directory : `directory`
Change data file being accessed, effectively using another TaskManager list.<br>
A manual restart of the application is required for non-Windows OS, thus TaskManager will close itself.
Format: `directory PATH` or `dir PATH`
